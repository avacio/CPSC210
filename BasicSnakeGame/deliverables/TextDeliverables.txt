Task M5: TWO BUGS

1. Method:  CanGrow (and thus Move, since it directly affects that method) ---testGrowOnFeed

Perhaps the source of the bug is that WebCAT's implementation may not keep track of the accumulative amount of
nutrition consumed. It could be basing the results of CanGrow on a singular food item, instead of adding the
nutritional value of all the food items, if they have yet to reach the value of NUTRITION_TO_GROW.

For example, if a food item's nutritional value is NUTRITION_TO_GROW/2, then obviously the snake cannot grow yet,
assuming it started at 0. If you add NUTRITION_TO_GROW/3, it should also not be able to grow since it would only
have NUTRITION_TO_GROW*5/6. Adding NUTRITION_TO_GROW/4, however should be sufficient in allowing the snake to
grow. If WebCAT's implementation did not account for the accumulation of food items with insufficient values,
then this could be the source of the bug.


2. Method:  RotateRight

This bug is that the <RIGHT> direction was expected when rotating right from <UP>, but it instead got the
<UP> direction. A possible source for this bug is that WebCAT's implementation did not specify the case for when
the initial direction is <UP> correctly. It could mistakenly have specified the next direction after RotateRight
is called from the <UP> direction, to remain at <UP>, instead of the <RIGHT> direction as to be expected.

================
Task M6:

This test fails because they did not design the test with the principle of a "single point of control"
in mind. Specifically, they did not design the test in terms of the constant, but instead used the specific
number "5" which is the number of columns divided by 2 in the termination argument. Thus when the number
of columns changed, the test remained the same and did not adjust to the changed constant.
